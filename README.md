##Branches rules

If you develop some feature create a branch features/[backend/frontend/mobile]/feature_description

If your feature is ready create a *pull request* into **DEVELOP** branch

If a whole set of features is ready make a pull request from *develop* to **release**

If you find some bug in the develop, release or main branch, create a hotflix branch like hotflix/develop/what_are_you_fixing

Useful commands:
- Change branch name: git branch -m new-name, while being checked out on the branch
- Delete branch: git branch -d branch-name
